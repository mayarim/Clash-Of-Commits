# OOGA Retrospective Discussion

## Project's current progress
Our project has been making good progress, with many
features being added regularly. Additionally, we are working
on adding more testing for greater coverage, and re-factoring
code to be better organized. For example, there is
currently a lot of code in the Controller class that will soon
be re-factored into Model and View. Furthermore, we still have
quite a few static variables/methods that we are working on
changing to non-static.

## Current level of communication
Frequent texting in our group chat to update about progress,
including merges, conflicts, and major changes with code structure.

We meet more often than the average 307 team, and are quite
communicative about issues/what we're working on each week.

## Satisfaction with team roles
Overall satisfaction with team roles. We do
whatever we sign up for each week.


## Teamwork that worked well
* Having a break for once in my life
* Pair programming is effective, in-person and via zoom
* Having frequent meetings to keep everyone caught up as much as possible
* Pushing and pulling often and not pushing broken code mitigated the majority of merge conflicts
* Our longest method is 24 lines which is very good + we have very few magic values
* Got most of our issues resolved by the end
* Our game is the most aesthetically pleasing, I said what I said
* Our game actually started resembling a game
* People working on their issues effectively
* People commit pretty regularly and often


## Teamwork that could be improved

* Having to film a 20-minute video at a late hour on a day many of us were traveling
* Having to talk in the video, overcoming a lot of anxiety
* Communication across different parts of the project (view vs model)
* What are people working on, how do different aspects of the code work?
    * Not knowing this makes it harder to integrate different people’s code with each other
* Not a ton of new tests
    * good overall coverage, but certain classes/methods are way better tested than others
* Design disagreements
    * where different code should go to be best organized
    * static variables/methods
    * compromising functionality for design
* Schedule conflicts when doing video
* Why did we have to stand during the standing meeting
* Need to change a lot of the strings to String.format(“”) etc. bc Robert said so (and make sure you load them in through the labelsbundle properties file)– and make them into private static final String instead of using the actual “string” in code
* Comment classes and methods more to enhance understanding about what is going on in this household
* Need to update our backlog doc



## Teamwork to improve next Sprint
* Continue working on issues in the backlog
* Focus on implementing attacks and load/save structure
* Work on handling errors more elegantly, rather than
  simply catching and throwing exceptions
* Further communication about merging updates
* Continuing to Pair Program as it was quite
