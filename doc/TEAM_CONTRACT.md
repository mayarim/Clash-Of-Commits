# OOGA Team Contract
### Team Number: 06
### Names: Nicki Lee, Mayari Merchant, James Qu, Melanie Wang, Nick Ward


## As a project team, we promise to:
* respect each other's ideas and work
* communicate with the team regularly to keep everyone in the loop about the project
* make regular git commits and let the team know when the master branch has been changed
* make progress throughout the week so that the team isn't forced to cram work in at the last minute

## If someone on our team breaks one or more of these promises, the team may:
* have a team meeting and ask the person to follow this agreement
* report the issue in the Team Sprint Report
* ask the professor or TA's for help communicating to that person


## Team Procedures
* We plan to meet twice a week at a minimum.
* We will meet either in person or over Zoom and communicate through a group chat.
* We plan to commit regularly as well as work on our own named branches.


### Meetings
* We will note action items on a shared Google Doc to collectively keep track of what each 
member is working on.
* If someone has to miss a meeting, they will be expected to communicate that over our group chat.
* We promise to handle points of disagreement during meetings in a respectful and productive
manner to make sure everyone feels heard. 


### Communications
* We will have a decision-making policy based on consensus after team discussions.
* Team members should respond as soon as they are able – preferably within 24 hours over group chat.
* Besides team meetings, we will use our group chat as well as the shared Google Doc to keep
team members informed and up to date.


### Commitments
* To work to the best of your ability means to put one's best effort forward for the specified goal – including 
acknowledging when help is needed if that will lead to the most optimal outcome. 
* As a team, each week we will establish mini-milestones to aim to accomplish before our next meeting. This will
ensure we are continuously making progress and setting reachable goals. 
* Every member of the team will be responsible for setting internal deadlines and communicating those deadlines to
to the team. We will relly on those commitments knowing everyone will put forth a good faith effort to follow 
through on their promises. We will also periodically check in on other members to make sure everyone is making progress
or find out if someone needs help. 
* It is each member's responsibility to communicate if they predict not being able to meet a commitment they have 
made to the team. Other members are expected to be understanding of extenuating circumstances and work together to
resolve the issue. 


### Helping each other
* During our team meetings or over group chat, members should communicate if they need help as soon as they notice
they are having difficulty completing their designated task. 
* As a team, we promise to work collaboratively to help one another by sharing our skillsets, experience,
or simply by brainstorming solutions. We will try to distribute workload to make sure no members feel too overwhelmed.
* We will make a priority list on our Google Doc which will help keep everyone on track.
* how to suggest design changes for specific pieces of code
* Our team will remain open to suggestions from any member about design changes. Those suggestions can be communicated
during our team meetings to ensure everyone remains informed about our design goals. When making a suggestion to change 
code, team members will explain why the change may be beneficial as well as how it could be implemented.
