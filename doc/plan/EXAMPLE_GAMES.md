## Example games in the Side-Scroller genre

1. Side-View games: 
   * Super Mario Bros, etc: games where the player 
   can actively move in 2 dimensions: forward/backward and up/down 
   * Relies on a gravity component for up/down movement 
   * Requires the background screen to move rather than
   the character itself upon "movement" input from player 

2. Top-View games: 
   * 8-bit Zelda, Stardew Valley, etc: games where the 
    player can actively move in 2 dimensions: forward/backward and 
    left/right 
   * Requires 2D "grid" for original game specifications 
    as loaded from file 
   * Background screen must move in 2 dimensions in 
   response to user input 

3. Auto-scroll games: 
    * Piano tiles, Jet Pack Joyride, Flappy Bird, etc.: games 
    where the screen scrolls independently of user input, and 
    the player must continue to meet requirements in order 
    to not die 
    * Players actively move in only one direction (up/down, 
    in the case of Flappy Bird and Jet Pack Joyride) 
    * Easier scrolling implementation because it does not 
   rely on user-input
