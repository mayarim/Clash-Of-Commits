#### What Features are Easy to Add

## High-level Design

Summary:
A side scroller game where you play as a programmer who must traverse the map, 
avoiding and defeating "bad coding practice" enemies. The hero programmer can
activate various "good coding practice" power-ups and abilities to help them 
reach the end of the map.
